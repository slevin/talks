yin yang of programming

part of code is implementing features

part is implementing the code


there are two sets of constraints

external constraints
- user features
- performance/reliability

internal constraints
- it has to work with existing lines of code

examples of how existing code must change in
order to accommodate a new external constraint
because there is an unsatisfiability problem

category theory point of view?
code is a mapping of all possible inputs to all possible outputs

some diagram that shows the two sides


business requirements drive the need for software so obviously they come first
but there are unpredictable realities so a simple new feature may conflict
with existing code even if its simple and that may require changes

code can be changed in a myriad of ways to accommodate the new feature
if time is taken to work on the code such that it accommodates future changes better

my answer is to just take it when I feel its needed, but what if that were prescribed time

other development tools could make future changes faster
- tests
- debugging tools, inspectors
- fixtures
- logging
- ???

time could be spent on those

sometimes we just do it wrong, its hard to get it to work at all
sometimes the ideas don't just come
can we come back and say I want to do the same thing but better?
I think we should.

how do we carve out that time

can we add it to sprints?

do we just have to be aggressive and say, "I'm doing this"
is that smart to depend on a person who is a member of the job
community that is arguably more introverted and less socially agressive
than any group to be that way? and necessarily fight against the
buisness people and managers who are feature focused?

they are concerned about speed too but its even harder for them to predict
outside saying just focus on this feature

shouldn't our process make time for this unescabable reality?
