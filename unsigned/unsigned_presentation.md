# Unsigned integer are Stoopid

### True Story about me
![inline](./unsignedrage.png)

### Super sweet code

```objectivec
NSDate *startTime = [NSDate date];
NSTimeInterval seconds = 60 * 60 * 24 * [daysArray count] * -1;
startTime = [startTime dateByAddingTimeInterval:seconds];
```

<br/>

count returns NSUInteger

converts -1 into 2,147,483,647

startTime ~= 23,000 days in the future

# Interview Queston
```c
int si = -1;
unsigned int ui = 1;
if (si < ui) {
    printf("The secret admin password is k1ttenz");
} else {
    printf("Here your cash. Thank you for use ATM.");
}
```

<br/>
Totally secure, ship it!

## Twos Complement

```
0111 1111 /*  127 */
1000 0000 /* -128 */
```

If we used a sign bit, we get +0 and -0

That would be silly.

### Why?

* Maybe made sense when you could only have 256 element array.

* Makes a lot less sense when you can have 9,223,372,036,854,775,807

* I don't know what that number is.

* Autoconvert: c, c++, objective-c, d, rust (with warning)
* Java has no unsigned integer (1 out of 9,456,245)
* c# and go will upconvert if there is room to grow
* Swift tells you to f off
* Ada has no unsigned, but does have, a mod type and a natural subtype
* Lua & Javascript only have floats
* Elixir rulez

## Swift

"Use UInt only when you specifically need an unsigned integer type with the same size as the platformâ€™s native word size. If this is not the case, Int is preferred, even when the values to be stored are known to be non-negative."
<br/>

Also array.count returns Int in Swift

# TL;DR
Don't use.
